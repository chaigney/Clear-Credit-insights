# Preparing Examiner-Ready Credit Memos for C&I and CRE Loans

Senior credit officers must ensure that credit memoranda for Commercial & Industrial (C&I) and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans meet rigorous regulatory standards. U.S. bank regulators expect credit memos to demonstrate sound underwriting and thorough documentation consistent with safety and soundness guidelines. In practice, an “examiner-ready” credit memo is one that clearly lays out all relevant information and analysis needed for an informed credit decision, in line with regulatory guidance. According to the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (adopted by OCC and FDIC), banks must maintain loan documentation practices that enable informed lending decisions, identify the loan’s purpose and repayment source, and demonstrate ongoing credit administration appropriate to the loan’s size and complexity. Likewise, prudent underwriting standards should consider the borrower’s overall financial condition, the support of any guarantors, the value of collateral, and the borrower’s character and willingness to repay. In short, a strong credit memo serves as the official “full risk assessment of the borrower” and supports the loan approval by addressing all key credit factors.

Below, we outline the essential components of a robust credit memorandum, from borrower background through covenant structure, and provide guidance on common examiner criticisms and how to avoid them. This practical guide draws on regulatory expectations and offers tips to align your credit memo format with examiner review processes.

### Borrower Background and Character

Begin the memo with a concise borrower profile. Examiners expect to see who the borrower is, what they do, and their qualifications. Provide a brief history of the business, its ownership and management team, and the industry context. Include relevant details such as the borrower’s legal structure, length of time in business, and key principals or sponsors. Emphasize management’s experience and reputation, as these speak to the borrower’s character and capacity. In regulatory terms, “character” and willingness to repay are foundational, OCC guidance explicitly includes the borrower’s character and willingness to repay as factors to assess.
In this section, clearly state the purpose of the loan (e.g. working capital, equipment purchase, real estate acquisition) and how it fits the borrower’s operations or expansion plans. This addresses the requirement to identify the purpose of a loan in the documentation. If the borrower has multiple affiliates or is part of a larger corporate group, note the structure and any relationship that could affect credit risk (for example, parent or subsidiary support, or if the loan is to a special-purpose entity, who the sponsor is). All of this background sets the stage for the financial and risk analysis to follow.

**Best practices:** Keep the background factual and objective. Avoid marketing language and instead provide specific details that establish the borrower’s profile (ownership, business lines, market position) and any risk-relevant history (such as prior successes or challenges). If the borrower or related entities have prior borrowing history with the bank, mention their track record. This context will help examiners understand the credit in perspective. Finally, ensure that the loan terms, amount, type of facility (revolver, term loan, etc.), and collateral, are summarized here or in a term sheet section, so that readers know the basic deal upfront. 

### Financial Analysis (Spread and Ratio Analysis)

A core of the credit memo is the financial analysis of the borrower, often presented as spreads of financial statements with commentary. This section should demonstrate the borrower’s historical and current financial performance, and provide insight into future capacity to service the debt. Regulators expect a current and complete credit analysis of the borrower’s financial condition. Key elements include:

**Income Statement Analysis:** Discuss revenue trends, profit margins, and expense control. Highlight growth rates or volatility in sales, and explain any one-time gains or losses. Examiners will expect you to comment on earnings consistency and the quality of earnings (e.g. reliance on non-recurring income).

**Cash Flow Analysis:** Provide a cash flow summary (EBITDA, operating cash flow) and calculate debt service coverage ratios (DSCR). This is crucial for demonstrating repayment capacity (covered further below). Compare cash flow against debt requirements to show if the borrower consistently generates enough cash to cover interest and principal payments. If global cash flow (combined cash flow of a borrower and its affiliates/guarantors) is relevant, include that analysis as well.

**Balance Sheet Analysis:** Evaluate liquidity, leverage, and capital structure. Include key ratios such as current ratio, leverage ratio (debt-to-equity), and working capital changes. Note any concentration of assets or liabilities (e.g. customer receivables, reliance on short-term debt).

**Trends and Projections:** Examiners appreciate seeing not just historical figures but also management’s projections or a sensitivity analysis. If the borrower provided forecasts, include a brief analysis of those and whether assumptions appear reasonable. Spread commentary means you should write a narrative explaining what the numbers mean. For example, “Gross margins declined from 30% to 25% in the past year due to rising raw material costs, which squeezed cash flow by 15%. However, the company implemented pricing adjustments that are expected to restore margin to ~28% next year.” This kind of commentary ties the financial data to business conditions.

**Comparative Context:** Use benchmarks such as industry averages or prior year results to give examiners a measuring stick. If the borrower’s leverage or margins are outside industry norms, acknowledge that and explain why (mitigants could include stable cash flow, competitive advantages, etc.). Providing financial benchmarks shows that you have measured the borrower against external standards, which is something examiners value for context.

**Source of Repayment:** In most C&I credits, the primary source is the company’s operating cash flow; for CRE, it’s typically property rental income or sale proceeds. Make it explicit: e.g., “Primary repayment will come from the company’s operating cash flow, which produced a DSCR of 1.5x in the last fiscal year.” This ties the financial analysis to repayment capacity. Regulators emphasize that the primary consideration in credit risk is the strength of the borrower’s primary repayment source. They expect banks to base risk assessments on the probability that the borrower’s cash flow can repay the debt, rather than assuming collateral will save the day.

Lastly, double-check the accuracy and consistency of your financial figures. Common examiner criticisms include math errors in spreads or inconsistencies between figures in the memo and the actual financial statements. Having another analyst review the spreads or using reliable software can help prevent these errors. The OCC specifically notes the importance of training staff to ensure accuracy and consistency in financial analysis and cash flow calculations. Accurate financial analysis not only aids your credit decision but also builds examiner confidence in your bank’s credit administration.

### Repayment Capacity and Cash Flow

While related to the financial analysis, repayment capacity deserves focused attention in the memo. This section distills whether the borrower can realistically meet debt service requirements from its operations or other sources. Examiners will look for a clear statement of how the loan will be repaid. Include both the primary source of repayment (usually operating cash flow for C&I loans, or project income/refinance for CRE loans) and secondary sources (such as collateral liquidation, guarantees, or refinancing). Start by quantifying the primary repayment capacity. For term loans, calculate the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). For example, “Projected DSCR is 1.4x based on the borrower’s EBITDA of $2.8MM against annual debt service of $2.0MM, indicating adequate coverage.” Discuss the quality of this cash flow (is it stable? dependent on certain contracts or cycles?) and whether it’s expected to grow or face challenges. If seasonal or cyclical, note how the borrower manages those fluctuations (perhaps via a revolver for working capital). Next, acknowledge the secondary source of repayment. In many cases, this is the collateral (which we address in the next section) or a guarantor. It might also be refinancing (for a construction loan that will be taken out by permanent financing) or sale of the asset. Be frank about what the Plan B is if cash flow falters. For example, “Secondary repayment would come from the sale of the equipment collateral, which is valued at $500M (125% of loan amount). The equipment is readily marketable, providing a viable fallback if needed.” Another example for CRE: “Secondary source is refinancing with a long-term mortgage upon stabilization of the property.” Examiners want to see that both primary and secondary exit strategies have been considered. 

Importantly, analyze the adequacy of the repayment sources, don’t just list them. Regulators expects an analysis of the adequacy of the primary and secondary repayment sources. This means if the primary source is not 100% reliable, explain how the secondary source covers the shortfall. For instance, if a CRE project’s primary source is leasing income, you might present a sensitivity (e.g., occupancy dropping to 85%) and show that DSCR remains above 1.2x, or if not, that the guarantor’s support or a cash reserve could cover the gap. This kind of stress scenario strengthens the memo by demonstrating foresight. In fact, sound underwriting practices often include “feasibility studies and sensitivity analysis” for CRE projects, and examiners will review a bank’s documentation of its stress testing and assess whether the institution’s scenarios (like lower income or higher interest rates) still indicate full and timely repayment. In a practical sense, incorporating a brief adverse case (downside scenario) in the memo shows the loan’s resilience. For example, mention the minimum DSCR or cash buffer under a moderate downturn scenario. When discussing repayment, tie it back to loan terms. Note the amortization schedule and whether there is a balloon payment, as this affects repayment risk. For interest-only periods or bullet loans, explicitly address the plan for principal repayment (e.g., refinance or sale) and why it is realistic. This is particularly important for CRE loans with balloon maturities, regulators will expect to see that you’ve considered refinance risk or have mitigants like strong loan-to-value and stable NOI to facilitate take-out financing.

In summary, this section should convince the reader that “the borrower can repay the indebtedness in a timely manner” from identified sources. If there are any weaknesses acknowledge them and describe how they’re mitigated (e.g. covenants to prevent over-leveraging, or requiring a cash reserve, etc.). Transparency about repayment capacity, backed by quantitative measures, is key to an examiner-ready memo.

### Collateral and Security Evaluation

For secured loans, regulators expect a thorough collateral analysis in the credit memo. This section should detail what assets secure the loan, their values, and the bank’s lien position. Examiners will verify that the collateral is properly valued and legally enforceable as security for the loan. Key items to cover:

**Description of Collateral:** Identify the collateral type (e.g., Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Equipment, Commercial Real Estate property at 123 Main St., etc.). Be specific and include property addresses for real estate, VINs for vehicles, etc., as applicable.

**Appraised Value and Date:** Provide the most recent appraised or evaluated value of the collateral and the date of the valuation. For real estate, this means including the appraisal value (and whether it is “as is” or stabilized value) and when the appraisal was done (and by whom, if relevant). For other collateral like inventory or equipment, the memo might rely on book value or an appraisal/inspection report. The OCC has directed banks that credit memos should state “the appraised value of supporting collateral, with the date and source of the appraisal”[9].

**Lien Position and Perfection:** Clarify the bank’s lien position (1st lien, 2nd lien, etc.) and whether the security interest is perfected. For real estate, note if it’s a first mortgage and that title/lien filings will be completed. If another creditor has a charge on the collateral, mention any intercreditor or subordination arrangements. Essentially, examiners want assurance that any claim against the borrower is legally enforceable and proper lien perfection and documentation are part of that.

**Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Calculate the LTV ratio for the collateral. Compare this to policy limits or regulatory guidelines. For example, if it’s CRE, note how the LTV stands against supervisory limits (e.g., 70% LTV on a commercial property, well under the 85% regulatory guideline for CRE). High LTVs should be justified with mitigants (e.g., strong guarantor or cash flow).

**Collateral Condition and Marketability:** Comment on the condition and marketability of the collateral. For CRE, mention occupancy rates or the quality of the property (Class A office, etc.) and market conditions (rental market demand, cap rates in that area). For equipment or inventory, note if they are standard or specialized, which affects ease of liquidation. If the collateral is a stock or other financial instrument, note current market value and any volatility.

**Monitoring and Margins (if applicable):** If the loan is secured by assets that fluctuate in value (like accounts receivable or inventory in a borrowing base, or securities portfolio), describe the margin and monitoring arrangements. For example, “The loan will be advanced at 80% of eligible receivables; collateral reports will be submitted monthly and must show a 125% collateral coverage.” This shows examiners that you have a system to maintain collateral adequacy.

All collateral information should be well-documented. One common shortcoming is when the memo lacks support for collateral values. Ensure that an appraisal or evaluation summary is either included or referenced. If an appraisal is older, note any updates or whether you’ve applied a discount to be conservative. Examiners may also look for evidence of proper collateral documentation, filings, insurance, etc. While the credit memo may not list every document, it should at least note that requirements like hazard insurance or UCC filings will be in place. Remember, the Interagency Guidelines require banks to ensure “any claim against a borrower is legally enforceable” and that collateral documentation is appropriate. For CRE loans, highlight whether the appraisal meets regulatory standards and if an internal appraisal review was done. If there are environmental concerns (e.g., a Phase I environmental assessment needed), mention their status, as this can affect collateral value and marketability. By clearly laying out collateral details, you both demonstrate the secondary source of repayment and address safety and soundness expectations. The OCC, for instance, wants credit memos to document collateral values and the bank’s lien position before funding the loan. Providing this in the memo helps examiners verify that collateral support was properly evaluated at origination.

### Risk Rating and Justification

Every credit memo should state the risk rating assigned to the loan (or the credit relationship) and provide a rationale for that rating. Examiners will scrutinize whether the risk rating is accurate and supported by the analysis in the memo. In fact, regulators have codified that institutions must have independent, ongoing credit review and accurate risk ratings consistent with regulatory classification standards. Therefore, use this section to demonstrate that you applied your bank’s risk rating system correctly based on the credit’s risk profile.

**State the Rating:** Identify the internal risk rating or grade (for example, “Pass – Grade 4” or “Special Mention” or whatever your bank’s terminology is). If your bank uses a numerical scale, you might say “Risk Rating: 4 (Moderate Risk, Pass category).” It’s often helpful to include a brief definition for context (e.g., “Grade 4 – Acceptable risk with some weaknesses, but manageable under current conditions”). This signals to examiners that you understand the meaning of the rating.

**Provide Justification:** Clearly explain why this loan merits that risk rating. Tie the justification to specific aspects of the borrower’s financial strength, cash flow, collateral, and overall risk factors discussed earlier. For example: “We assign a Pass (Rating 4) because the borrower’s solid cash flow (1.5x DSCR) and strong collateral coverage (50% LTV) indicate a low likelihood of default. The company is profitable and has stable operations, although high customer concentration presents some risk a factor reflected in our rating but mitigated by long-term contracts in place.” This narrative should connect the dots between analysis and rating.

Regulatory guidance from the OCC’s “Rating Credit Risk” handbook emphasizes that the primary factor in risk rating is the strength of the borrower’s repayment capacity. In other words, the risk rating should chiefly reflect the probability of default based on the borrower’s ability to repay from primary sources. Therefore, your justification should highlight repayment metrics (like DSCR, leverage, trends) more heavily than collateral, especially for performing loans. Collateral comes more into play for loss severity considerations, but regulators have noted that risk ratings should focus on probability of default rather than risk of loss for the purpose of classification. Ensure your memo follows this principle, a loan shouldn’t get a pass solely because there’s plenty of collateral if the borrower’s financials are actually very weak; examiners would likely question that inconsistency. Additionally, mention any triggers or early warning signs that could prompt a rating change in the future (if relevant). This shows proactive risk management. For instance, “The rating assumes continuation of current performance; a sustained drop in DSCR below 1.1x or the loss of a major customer would warrant a downgrade to Special Mention.” This kind of statement isn’t mandatory, but it evidences that you are monitoring conditions that affect credit risk.

If the loan is on the borderline of two grades, it’s wise to acknowledge the weaknesses but explain why, on balance, it fits the assigned grade. Transparency is important. Examiners are aware of potential bias to understate risk, so explicitly referencing bank policy or rating criteria can back up your decision. For example, “Per our bank’s credit risk rating policy, a Grade 4 is appropriate for borrowers with DSCR above 1.2x and leverage < 3.0x; this borrower meets those benchmarks. While liquidity is a bit light, other factors compensate, keeping the rating in a pass category.” Also ensure that any policy exceptions related to underwriting (like if this credit slightly missed a guideline but was still approved) are documented here or in a separate section. Often, risk rating narratives should note if the loan required higher approval authority due to exceptions or elevated risk. In our OCC example, they specifically require “clear identification of all exceptions to the loan policy, with proper approval by the board or committee before funding”. Examiners will cross-check that exceptions were identified and approved, and recurring exceptions can influence how they view the risk governance. So it might be suitable to mention, “This loan was approved with an exception on loan-to-value (90% vs. policy max 85%), which was authorized by the Credit Committee given the additional collateral and guaranty support.” That could also fall under a separate section, but it ties into risk acceptance.

Finally, ensure the risk rating in the memo is updated for the latest information. If you’re preparing a memo for a renewal or modification, don’t just carry over last year’s rating without considering current financials and conditions. An outdated rating is a red flag. The Interagency Guidelines instruct that credit underwriting include systems to monitor existing credits for deterioration in primary or secondary repayment sources and that risk ratings be reviewed whenever new information arises. Therefore, an examiner-ready memo will demonstrate that the rating is current and well-supported by analysis at that point in time.

### Covenant Structure and Monitoring

Strong credit memos not only propose a loan but also define how the loan will be managed after approval. A key tool for managing credit risk is the covenant package. Examiners will check that the memo outlines appropriate covenants (financial and non-financial) to help mitigate risk and provide early warnings of any borrower difficulties. Moreover, they will look for consistency, the covenants listed in the credit memo should make it into the final loan agreement and be properly monitored.

In this section, list the covenants that will be part of the loan terms and explain why they are appropriate. Typical covenants for C&I loans may include: minimum debt service coverage ratio, maximum leverage ratio, minimum tangible net worth, or limitations on additional debt or liens. For CRE loans, covenants might include minimum debt service coverage, limits on distributions if DSCR falls, requirements to maintain occupancy above a certain level, or completion milestones for construction loans. Also consider reporting covenants (e.g., quarterly financial statements, borrowing base certificates, rent rolls for CRE, etc.). Provide the specifics: for example, “Borrower must maintain a DSCR (EBITDA/Debt Service) of at least 1.25x tested quarterly”, or “Maintain a maximum Debt-to-Tangible Net Worth of 3.0x”. If there are performance milestones (as in construction or development loans), state them: “Project to achieve a minimum pre-lease level of 50% before lease-up period funding is advanced.” Explain briefly how these covenants help manage risk. “These covenants will allow the bank to intervene or adjust terms if the borrower’s performance deteriorates. For instance, the minimum DSCR covenant ensures the company maintains sufficient cash flow cushion; a breach would prompt closer review or action to safeguard repayment.” This rationale shows examiners you’re proactively structuring the deal to maintain soundness.

Indicate how covenant compliance will be monitored. Examiners appreciate when memos mention the frequency of financial reporting and covenant checks (e.g., “Borrower will provide quarterly CPA-reviewed financials; the credit department will perform covenant compliance checks after each reporting period.”). Many banks have covenant tracking systems and referencing that the covenants will be tracked in the bank’s monitoring system and reviewed by credit admin or loan officers is a good practice to mention. This addresses the safety and soundness expectation that loans will be appropriately monitored over time. Be very cautious to ensure that any covenants promised in the credit memo are actually included in the loan documents. A common examiner criticism is when the memo references covenants that never ended up in the executed loan agreement or were worded differently. Such discrepancies can render covenants unenforceable and undermine the bank’s position. To avoid this, coordinate closely with your loan closing team or counsel to confirm all covenants from the approval are carried into the final documents. Your memo can even note “Standard covenant package per approval will be incorporated in loan documents by counsel, including financial reporting, DSCR >1.25x, etc.” as reassurance.

If the loan has no covenants, consider if that’s truly prudent. Examiners have frequently pointed out weaknesses in credits that had “lenient terms and weak loan structuring”, such as lack of covenants or interest-only terms without sufficient justification. If you choose to go covenant-light, the memo should document why (e.g., low leverage, self-liquidating short-term loan, borrower’s exceptional credit profile) to preempt examiner concerns.

In summary, the covenant structure section should detail the rules of the road for the borrower post-disbursement and how the bank will monitor and enforce those rules. A well-crafted covenant package, clearly documented, demonstrates that the bank is mitigating risks identified in the analysis. By affirming active monitoring, you align with regulatory expectations for ongoing loan administration.

### Guarantor Analysis

When guarantors or co-borrowers are part of the credit, the memo must analyze their financial strength and support as well. Examiners will expect to see that you have underwritten any guarantor with a material role in the credit. In fact, the Interagency Guidelines stipulate considering “the financial responsibility of any guarantor” prior to credit commitment, and OCC-required credit memo content includes “analysis of current and complete credit information on all guarantors”. This section is where you document that analysis.

Identify each guarantor (or each principal if the loan is recourse to key individuals, for example). Describe the guarantor’s relationship to the borrower (owner, parent company, etc.) and the extent of the guarantee (joint and several, limited to a certain amount, etc.). Then provide an analysis of their financial capacity:

**Personal Guarantors (Individuals):** Include a summary of the individual’s net worth, liquidity, and income sources. Typically, you would have a personal financial statement (PFS) and perhaps tax returns. Highlight liquid assets (cash, marketable securities) as well as total net worth. Examiners focus on liquidity because a guarantor’s ability to inject cash is more relevant than illiquid assets. For example, “Guarantor John Doe has a stated net worth of $5 million, primarily in real estate equity; liquid assets are ~$500,000. Annual income is $300,000, which provides additional support capacity if needed.” Comment on any contingent liabilities or other guarantees they have, since that affects their real capacity. If multiple individual guarantors, assess each or indicate if one is significantly stronger.

**Corporate Guarantors:** If another company is guarantying, analyze that company much like you do the borrower. Provide its financial highlights and credit metrics. Examiners will expect essentially a mini credit analysis of the guarantor entity. If the guarantor is a parent or affiliate, mention its debt load and ability to service this loan’s obligations if called upon.

**Global Cash Flow:** When guarantors are involved, especially principals who have multiple business interests, it’s good practice to present a global cash flow analysis. This combines the cash flows of the borrower and guarantors and any other related entities, as appropriate, to see the overall ability to service debt across the group. OCC guidance specifically calls for “a global cash flow analysis” in credit memos where there are multiple obligors. For example, if the borrower is an LLC owned by an individual who has other businesses, a global analysis might show the individual’s income plus the LLC’s cash flow versus the sum of personal and business debt requirements. Show that this global DSCR is acceptable, or if not, explain mitigants.

After presenting the numbers, assess the willingness of the guarantor to support the loan. This can be subjective, but consider the guarantor’s track record (have they supported their businesses before? is there any history of litigation or avoiding obligations?). Also note if the guarantee is being secured by any collateral (like a secured guaranty or negative pledge on certain assets). Examiners appreciate candor, if a guarantor is weak or only included to discourage bad behavior, say so and focus on the primary source still being the borrower. Conversely, if the guarantor significantly strengthens the credit, make that clear. “The guarantor’s strong personal liquidity and outside net worth provide a secondary repayment source and a deterrent to default, materially improving the credit’s risk profile.” Document any verification done on guarantor information. For instance, tax transcripts (common for SBA-guaranteed loans or larger credits) or credit reports on the guarantor. If a guarantor’s credit score or any public records are notable, mention them if relevant to their support capability.

Finally, state whether the guaranty is unconditional and continuing, and that guarantors have been informed or have signed (in a prospect stage memo, you might state “guarantors have agreed in principle to provide their personal guarantees”). Examiners sometimes find that “guarantees” noted in memos were not actually executed properly; ensure that’s not the case in practice.

In summary, treat the guarantor as an integral part of the credit analysis. A strong guarantor can mitigate weaknesses of the borrower, but only if the analysis shows they truly have capacity to fulfill the obligation. By including a solid guarantor analysis, you satisfy the regulatory expectation that all obligors’ repayment abilities are assessed prior to lending.

### Common Shortcomings Flagged by Examiners (and How to Avoid Them)

Even well-intentioned credit memos can fall short of examiner expectations if certain elements are missing or handled poorly. Here we highlight some common shortcomings examiners frequently cite, along with tips to avoid them:

**Incomplete or Outdated Financial Information:** Examiners often find memos that rely on stale financials or omit analysis of the most recent performance period. **Avoidance:** Always use the most recent financial statements available (interim statements if the annual is old) and note the date. If information is pending (e.g., an audit), acknowledge it and perhaps include preliminary figures. Never assume last year’s numbers still hold, update your ratios and narrative accordingly. Ensure personal financial statements of guarantors are current (generally within 12 months).

**Lack of Clear Repayment Analysis:** Some memos merely state the sources of repayment without evaluating them. Examiners want to see analysis, not just assertions. **Avoidance:** Clearly articulate how primary repayment will occur and provide calculations for coverage. If saying “cash flow will repay,” show the math (cash flow vs. debt service). If saying “sale of asset,” indicate value and marketability. Also, incorporate stress testing. For instance, what if revenues drop 10%? Show that even then, debt could be serviced, or explain contingency plans. By demonstrating the loan’s resilience to stress, you address a major examiner focus.

**Overreliance on Collateral Value:** Many criticized memos place undue comfort in collateral without sufficient cash flow support. Examiners may flag a memo that reads “Fully secured, so risk is minimal” if the borrower’s ability to repay is in doubt. Remember that in the regulatory view, repayment capacity is primary and collateral is secondary. **Avoidance:** Even if collateral is abundant, still provide a thorough cash flow analysis and assign the risk rating based on the likelihood of repayment from operations. Collateral should be described as a secondary source and its limits acknowledged (e.g., costs to liquidate, market value volatility). If you have a collateral-heavy loan (like asset-based lending), ensure you discuss how collateral will be monitored and kept sufficient over time, not just its value at origination.

**Unjustified Risk Rating or Policy Exceptions:** Examiners frequently challenge risk ratings that appear too generous compared to the facts. If a borrower has weakening performance but the memo keeps a pass rating without explanation, expect questions. Similarly, any policy exceptions that are not disclosed will be viewed negatively. **Avoidance:** Provide a candid rationale for your risk rating, referencing the borrower’s condition relative to rating criteria. If there are adverse trends, either reflect them in a harsher rating or explain why mitigants warrant maintaining the rating. Also, list all approval conditions and exceptions in the memo, such transparency shows you’re not hiding deviations. For instance, if loan-to-value is above policy, explicitly state it and note that appropriate higher approvals were obtained. Hiding or glossing over an exception is far worse than disclosing it with justification.

**Poor Organization and Clarity:** A very common issue (though not an outright “violation”) is that memos are dense, rambling, or missing a logical flow, making it hard to find key information. Important details might be buried or repeated in different sections. **Avoidance:** Use a clear structure with headings and bullet points to guide the reader. Ensure the memo follows a logical progression (e.g., background → analysis → structure → recommendation). Keep paragraphs short and focused. Utilize tables or charts for financial data to improve readability. A well-organized memo not only pleases examiners but also reduces the chance they’ll overlook your positive points.	

**Inadequate Covenant or Post-Closing Follow-Up:** Examiners might note when a credit lacked covenants that could have prevented a problem, or when covenants were present but not enforced. Also, technical exceptions (like missing borrower financial statements or expired collateral inspections) are a common administrative finding. **Avoidance:** Include a meaningful covenant package as discussed, and document how it will be enforced. After loan closing, ensure someone is responsible for tracking items like financial reporting, borrowing base certificates, insurance renewals, etc. It’s wise to mention in the memo, if applicable, any requirements before funding (e.g., “subject to receipt of valid insurance certificate and UCC filing”) so that examiners see those conditions. Then, of course, follow through on them. Internal audit or loan review often picks up lapsed documentation, which then becomes an examiner issue.

**Ignoring Industry or Macro Factors:** Occasionally, a memo may focus so much on the borrower that it fails to address obvious external risks (e.g., the industry is in decline, or interest rates are rising impacting debt service). Examiners are attuned to these broader risks. **Avoidance:** Include a brief commentary on the industry outlook and any macroeconomic considerations. Even a couple of sentences acknowledging the market position or external risk with mitigants, if any, will improve the memo. For CRE loans, discuss local market conditions; for C&I, discuss competitive landscape or customer base stability. This shows a holistic risk assessment.

By addressing these common pitfalls, you make your credit memo far more robust. Think of it this way: an examiner should be able to read your memo and not have a laundry list of unanswered questions or missing pieces. If you pre-empt those questions in your writing, your memo is essentially “examiner-ready.”

### Tips for Aligning Your Memo with Examiner Expectations

To finalize, here are some practical tips to ensure your credit memo format and content align with what examiners typically look for:

**Follow Regulatory Guidance in Format:** Align your memo sections with the areas examiners focus on. As we’ve covered, ensure the memo clearly addresses purpose, repayment, collateral, financial analysis, covenants, risk rating, etc., because these map to the regulators’ underwriting expectations. You can even use similar headings (e.g., “Source of Repayment,” “Collateral,” “Risk Rating”) as this makes it easy for an examiner to verify each required element is present. The OCC Comptroller’s Handbook and FDIC examination manuals often have checklists; structuring your memo to hit all those points is a wise strategy.

**Be Clear and Concise:** The readability of the memo is very important. Examiners often have limited time with each credit file, so a clear presentation wins points. Use plain language and define any acronyms. Present complex information in tables or appendices for clarity. Maintain a factual yet confident tone, if the situation has negatives, don’t hide them; instead, state how they are mitigated by positives.

**Use Headings, Bullet Points, and White Space:** As mentioned, format the memo so key facts jump out. Headings and subheadings break up content logically (e.g., “Borrower Background,” “Financial Performance,” “Collateral,” etc.). Bullet points can efficiently list items like covenants, guarantor assets, or examination findings. Adequate white space (and perhaps tables or text boxes for key ratios) makes the memo easier to scan. The goal is that an examiner or committee member can quickly locate the main risk factors and mitigants without wading through walls of text[25].

**Document, Document, Document:** A memo might be well-written, but if the file lacks supporting documents, the examiner will still cite issues. Ensure that all facts in the memo are backed by documentation in the credit file: financial statements, appraisal reports, loan agreements, etc. For example, if you say the collateral appraised at $2 million, have the appraisal in file and reference the date in the memo. If you quote financial covenants, have a draft term sheet or credit agreement reflecting them. Consistency between the memo and the legal documents is crucial. As a best practice, some banks attach a covenant checklist or term sheet as an exhibit to the memo as this can help ensure nothing falls through the cracks when the loan is closed.

**Include Financial Benchmarks and Peer Comparisons:** We touched on benchmarks in financial analysis. Examiners find context very useful, it helps them gauge if your risk appetite is reasonable. Compare the borrower’s performance to industry averages (RMA spreads, for instance) or even to the bank’s portfolio norms. If a borrower’s leverage is higher than typical, you might note that but also explain compensating strengths. Including a brief comparison to policy limits or regulatory guidelines is also good. This shows you’re aware of and adhering to supervisory limits.

**Stress Scenarios and Sensitivity:** Make a habit of incorporating at least a rudimentary stress test in the memo. For example, “If interest rates rise 200 bps, pro forma DSCR would drop to 1.2x, which is still above 1.0x, indicating the loan could withstand rate shocks.” Or for a CRE loan, “If occupancy falls to 85% (from current 95%), the property could still cover debt service at ~1.1x DSCR.” These are the kinds of sensitivity analyses that supervisory guidance encourages banks to perform. Including them in the memo not only helps your internal decision, but signals to examiners that the bank is forward-looking about risk. It aligns with the regulatory direction that banks use stress testing to assess vulnerabilities in concentrations or large credits.

**Executive Summary for Complex Credits:** If a credit memo is very large or complex, say a big CRE development or a syndicated loan, consider providing a short summary at the beginning. A few paragraphs or a bullet list summarizing the transaction, key risks, and mitigants can greatly assist an examiner’s review. They might mirror that in their workpapers, in fact. Ensure that the summary is consistent with the detailed sections that follow.

**Quality Control – Internal Review:** Before finalizing, have a second set of eyes review the memo. Internal credit review or a senior underwriter can often spot omissions or unclear explanations. This internal check can catch issues that an examiner would flag. It’s much better to fix it now than to answer a finding later. The OCC has emphasized ongoing training for loan officers to ensure consistency in credit analysis and risk rating practices. Part of that is learning from reviews and examinations to continually improve memo quality.

**Keep It “Evergreen”:** Since the question asks for an evergreen approach, design your credit memo template so that each annual review or renewal can build on the last. Examiners often look at the evolution of a credit. If last year’s memo noted a plan or a pending risk (e.g., a big balloon payment or expansion project), the next memo should update on that. Maintaining continuity and tracking previously identified issues shows diligent oversight. Don’t just copy last year’s memo forward, update it thoughtfully, addressing what has changed.

By implementing these practices, your credit memos will not only meet regulatory expectations but also serve as effective tools for credit decision-making and risk management. An examiner-ready memo ultimately reflects a sound credit culture: one that is transparent, thorough, and proactive about identifying and controlling risk. As a senior credit officer, instilling these standards in every memo will ensure that when examiners do arrive, your loan files speak for themselves in demonstrating safe and sound banking practices.
