Loan portfolio reviews are a critical tool for U.S. banks to manage credit risk and satisfy regulatory expectations. An effective loan review function is “integral to the safe and sound operation of every insured depository institution,” according to interagency guidance[1]. Whether your bank’s reviews are internal or required by regulators, avoiding common pitfalls can make the difference between a proactive risk management program and one that draws examiner criticism. Below are the top 10 mistakes seen in loan portfolio reviews – each mistake is explained, why it matters (including OCC/FDIC perspectives), the consequences, and practical ways to fix or avoid the issue.
1. Lack of Independent Loan Review
The Mistake: Failing to maintain an independent loan review process is a top mistake. This happens when the people reviewing loans are too close to the loan approval or management process – for example, loan officers reviewing their own loans or reviewers reporting to the lending line. Independence is crucial: “An independent assessment of risk is achieved when personnel who perform the loan review do not have control over the loan and are not part of or influenced by individuals associated with the loan approval process.”[2] If the review function isn’t sufficiently separate, objectivity can be compromised.
Why It Matters: Regulators expect an independent, ongoing credit risk review system as a safety and soundness standard[3]. When loan review lacks independence, it often results in overly optimistic loan ratings or ignored problems. Examiners commonly criticize loan review functions for this reason – in fact, many exam criticisms stem from risk-rating discrepancies when loan officers grade their own credits[4]. Without independent review, banks may miss early warning signs of credit deterioration, leading to misclassified loans and hidden risk.
Consequences: A non-independent review can cause misgraded loans to persist until they become serious problems. This may lead to surprise losses, inadequate loan loss reserves, and harsher findings from examiners. Banks in this situation often face examiner skepticism about the accuracy of their internal ratings and could be required to bring in outside reviewers or consultants.
How to Avoid/Fix: Establish clear separation of the loan review function. Ideally, loan review staff (or third-party reviewers) should report directly to the board or a board committee, not to the loan production line[5]. If your institution is small and can’t have a full separate department, consider rotating staff or using an independent committee or external firm periodically to review credits. The key is that reviewers must have no stake in the loan’s origination or approval. Also, have the board annually approve a loan review policy that affirms this independence and authority of the loan review team. Independent loan review not only meets regulatory expectations but also ensures a more honest assessment of credit risk, preventing “friendly biases” from masking problems.
2. Inaccurate or Delayed Risk Ratings
The Mistake: Another common pitfall is when loan reviews allow misgraded loans or outdated risk ratings to go uncorrected. Inaccurate or stale risk ratings – for example, continuing to rate a deteriorating credit as “Pass” when its financial condition has declined – undermine the entire credit risk management process. The OCC has made it clear that banks must produce “accurate and timely risk ratings” as part of sound credit risk management[6]. In practice, this mistake often comes from over-reliance on borrower payment status (e.g. “current” loans) or optimistic projections, rather than objective analysis of the borrower’s actual risk profile.
Why It Matters: Correct risk ratings are the foundation of an effective loan review system. They ensure management and directors understand the true risk in the portfolio[7][8]. When internal ratings are too slow to downgrade problem loans, several bad outcomes occur. First, the bank’s Allowance for Credit Losses may be understated because it isn’t factoring in emerging weaknesses[9][10]. Second, management is deprived of the opportunity to intervene early (through tighter covenants, restructuring, or exits) to mitigate losses. Regulators view frequent examiner downgrades of loans (i.e. examiners classifying loans more harshly than the bank does) as a clear signal of weaknesses in the bank’s rating system[8]. Such weaknesses can raise serious safety and soundness concerns and may result in enforcement actions requiring fixes[8].
Consequences: The consequences of misgraded loans include undetected credit deterioration and insufficient capital allocation for risks. In the worst case, a bank can suffer unexpected losses or require sudden increases in loan loss reserves, shocking earnings and capital. Examiner findings might include a mandate to strengthen the risk rating system or even re-rate large portions of the portfolio, consuming management time and potentially drawing negative attention from investors or the board.
How to Avoid/Fix: Build rigour into the credit risk rating process. Ensure that your risk rating framework has clear criteria for each grade and that loan officers’ ratings are independently reviewed and challenged as needed[11]. Implement triggers for review (such as financial covenant violations, declining borrower performance, or industry stress) so that risk ratings are evaluated promptly when conditions change. It’s also wise to conduct periodic independent validations of the risk rating system – for instance, have an outside party or separate unit sample loans to see if they would assign the same ratings[12]. Track differences between examiner ratings and your internal ratings; if examiners frequently downgrade your loans, treat that as a red flag to recalibrate your grading standards. In short, commit to keeping risk ratings current and accurate – this will ensure problems are recognized early and can be managed before losses mount.
3. Inadequate Portfolio Coverage in Reviews
The Mistake: Some banks conduct portfolio reviews on too narrow a slice of their loans – for example, only reviewing new loans or only troubled loans – and end up not covering the full risk spectrum of the portfolio. Inadequate scope or frequency of reviews is a common mistake. Every bank should periodically review all significant loans or at least a representative sample of the portfolio. If large portions of the book (by geography, industry, or loan type) are never reviewed, the bank is effectively flying blind in those areas.
Why It Matters: Regulators expect the loan review scope to be risk-based but comprehensive. The interagency guidance says an effective credit review system “provides for review and evaluation of an institution’s significant loans, loan products, or groups of loans typically annually... or more frequently when factors indicate potential for deteriorating credit quality.”[13] In practice, this means your loan review plan should ensure all major credit exposures are periodically assessed. If the review scope is too limited, you might miss emerging risks in parts of the portfolio that aren’t obvious problem loans yet. For example, if you skip reviewing an entire segment like commercial real estate or agriculture loans because they’re currently performing well, you could overlook brewing issues (e.g. market downturns, tenant vacancies, commodity price drops) until they hit with force.
Consequences: The danger of inadequate coverage is blind spots in risk oversight. A concentration of risk could build up unnoticed (see Mistake #4 below) or credit file deficiencies may proliferate in certain areas. Also, examiners may criticize the loan review function for not providing reasonable assurance that “all major credit risks have been identified.”[14] If a significant loan later goes bad and it was never reviewed, management and directors will face tough questions about why the loan review process failed to flag the issue. Additionally, lack of coverage can erode the credibility of the loan review program in the eyes of regulators and the board.
How to Avoid/Fix: Develop a risk-based loan review plan each year that defines the scope and coverage targets. Typically, you’ll want to review large loans (over a certain threshold) at least annually, and also cover a rotating sample of smaller loans that have higher risk characteristics (such as subprime credits, loans in industries under stress, loans on watch list, etc.)[15]. Ensure that together these reviews cover a high percentage of the portfolio’s total exposure – enough to give confidence that if there were systemic issues, they would surface. Also include various loan types and geographies over time. Use portfolio analytics to identify where risk is growing (for example, rapid loan growth in a new segment) and direct review resources there. By consciously mapping out coverage and tracking what’s been reviewed, you can avoid gaps. Remember, even well-performing portfolios deserve a “check-up” through loan review to confirm that credit quality truly remains sound and that underwriting standards are being maintained.
4. Overlooking Portfolio Risk Trends and Concentrations
The Mistake: Focusing only on individual loan write-ups and neglecting the bigger picture trends in the portfolio is a mistake that can undermine the effectiveness of loan reviews. Loan officers and even reviewers can sometimes get tunnel vision – evaluating each credit on its own, without aggregating findings to see emerging patterns. This mistake includes failing to identify risk concentrations (such as high exposure to a single industry, geographic region, or loan type) and not highlighting trends like widespread weakness in a particular segment.
Why It Matters: One of the core purposes of portfolio review is to “identify relevant trends affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio and isolate potential problem areas.”[16] In other words, beyond grading individual loans, the review should inform management where the risks are building up. Regulators (OCC and FDIC) pay close attention to concentrations of credit risk – for instance, a bank heavily concentrated in commercial real estate or oil & gas lending will get extra scrutiny. If your loan review reports don’t mention concentrations or trends, it’s a red flag that you might be missing the forest for the trees. Ignoring a concentration could mean the bank is one adverse event away from significant losses (e.g. a regional economic downturn or a collapse in a particular commodity price hitting many borrowers at once).
Consequences: The immediate consequence is missed early warnings. For example, if multiple loans in the portfolio are showing signs of stress (lower debt service coverage, higher leverage) in, say, the retail sector, and the review doesn’t synthesize that, management may not recognize a sector-wide issue. This can lead to inadequate strategic response (no tightening of lending standards or increase in reserves for that sector). Examiners will often criticize a bank for not properly monitoring and managing concentrations – it’s a common finding that a bank “failed to identify and address a growing concentration in [X] loans.” In severe cases, regulators may require a concentration mitigation plan or higher capital buffers. Additionally, without trend analysis, the board of directors is left without context; they see loan-by-loan detail but might not realize, for instance, that 20% of the portfolio is in one type of higher-risk credit – a risk appetite issue.
How to Avoid/Fix: Incorporate portfolio-level analysis into every loan review cycle. In practice, this means your loan review report to management and the board should include sections on: (a) concentration analysis – showing exposures by industry, product, or other key segments and identifying any segment that constitutes an outsized portion of capital; (b) trend analysis – summarizing if credit quality metrics (like average risk rating, delinquencies, or covenant breaches) are improving or deteriorating in each major segment; and (c) themes from the review – for example, “We noted several hospitality loans with weakening performance,” or “Agricultural loan quality is improving due to higher commodity prices,” etc. By highlighting such trends, loan review adds value beyond individual grades. Also leverage tools like watch lists and stress tests: ensure that if the bank has a watch list of problem loans, the loan review summary reports how that list has grown or shrunk and what’s driving it. Stress testing concentrated portfolios (e.g. if 30% of loans are CRE, showing how a drop in property values might impact the bank) is another good practice to inform management of concentration risk. In short, always zoom out after digging into individual loans – connect the dots and communicate the broader risk picture to management and regulators.
5. Poor Documentation and Reporting of Review Findings
The Mistake: Even when the loan review is looking at the right loans and identifying issues, a common mistake is insufficient documentation or reporting of those findings. This can take several forms: loan review write-ups that lack detail about why a loan’s risk rating was changed, reports that list problem loans but don’t explain root causes, or generally unstructured and inconsistent reporting to senior management. In short, the review may be happening, but the story isn’t being told in a clear, data-backed way.
Why It Matters: Clear documentation is essential for decision-making and for examiners to assess the effectiveness of your loan review. The board and senior management need more than just a list of loans that got downgraded; they need to understand why those downgrades happened and what the underlying issues are[17]. Without that, they can’t take informed action (like adjusting strategy or fixing underwriting weaknesses). Regulators expect loan review reports to be robust. In fact, experts note that one of the most pressing issues is when there’s “a lack of proper documentation for the root cause of the issue” in loan review reports[18]. If your loan review report says “Loan X downgraded to Substandard” but provides no context, it doesn’t help anyone and suggests a weak review process.
Consequences: Poor documentation can lead to miscommunication and inaction. For instance, a board member seeing a summary might not grasp the severity of issues if context isn’t provided – “Is this borrower downgraded because their industry is collapsing, or just a temporary cash flow hiccup?” Moreover, examiners will view thin documentation as a weakness. They may spend extra time to verify the portfolio themselves, which can prolong or complicate exams. In extreme cases, if the loan review function cannot provide evidence supporting its findings (e.g. financial analysis, collateral review, policy exception notes), examiners might discount the bank’s internal review conclusions altogether. This could result in more conservative examiner classifications or additional supervisory scrutiny. Additionally, lack of documentation often correlates with things being missed; if reasons for downgrades aren’t documented, maybe some downgrades weren’t done at all when they should have been.
How to Avoid/Fix: Standardize and strengthen loan review documentation. Each loan reviewed should have a brief write-up that includes key analysis points: current credit facts (financial performance, collateral valuation, covenant compliance), any deviations from policy, and the rationale for the risk rating or any changes. Review reports to the board should “tell the story of how the credit risk in your institution is changing from one period to another,” not just list classifications[17]. One practical tip is to include a summary table of all loans reviewed and the risk rating changes, alongside a narrative for each major credit that explains the drivers (e.g. “Borrower’s debt service coverage fell below 1.0x due to lower sales, hence downgraded to Special Mention”). Also include aggregate data – such as how many loans had financial statement exceptions or technical exceptions – to highlight any widespread issues. Utilize whatever loan review or portfolio management software available to pull data from various systems, so that your conclusions are backed by facts (for example, trends in borrowers’ financial ratios). Finally, ensure the frequency of reporting is adequate: a comprehensive loan review report should go to the board at least quarterly[19], with interim updates if material issues arise. Clear, thorough documentation will enable management and directors to act decisively and will instill examiner confidence in the loan review process.
6. Overlooking Policy Exceptions and Covenant Violations
The Mistake: Loan portfolio reviews sometimes focus too narrowly on credit risk metrics and overlook compliance with loan policy and covenants. A common mistake is failing to flag loans that violate the bank’s lending policies (such as exceeding loan-to-value limits or debt-to-income guidelines) or loans where borrowers are breaching covenants (like missing required financial reporting or violating financial ratio covenants). Ignoring these “technical” issues is risky – they often foreshadow deeper problems or indicate lapses in underwriting discipline.
Why It Matters: Part of an effective loan review is to “assess the adequacy of, and adherence to, loan policies and procedures,” as well as to check compliance with covenants, laws, and regulations[20][21]. These checks are there for a reason: policy exceptions might indicate that lending staff are stretching terms to book loans (which could mean higher risk loans are being made), and covenant violations often signal the borrower’s financial health is weakening. Regulators expect banks to monitor and control policy exceptions – a high level of exceptions without mitigation or board approval can draw criticism. Similarly, not tracking covenant compliance means the bank could be missing early warning signs of default. In loan reviews, if these issues aren’t routinely identified and reported, it suggests a gap in oversight.
Consequences: The consequences include credit losses and examiner criticism. For example, if a borrower has been out of compliance with a debt service coverage ratio covenant for two quarters and loan review doesn’t flag it, the bank might fail to act (such as increasing rates, strengthening collateral, or even calling the loan early to limit risk). If the borrower’s condition worsens, the bank ends up with a larger loss that could have been prevented. From a regulatory standpoint, a pattern of policy exceptions that haven’t been acknowledged or approved by the board will prompt examiners to question the bank’s credit culture and governance. They may cite the bank for weak internal controls or require a reduction in those exceptions. In severe cases, repeated covenant breaches not being handled could lead examiners to classify loans more harshly because they see management isn’t enforcing agreements that protect the bank.
How to Avoid/Fix: Embed policy and covenant checks into the loan review process. Create a checklist for reviewers to verify each loan’s compliance with key policy limits (LTV, debt service coverage, loan size limits, etc.) and to note any exceptions. Also have them check covenant tracking reports or the loan file for signs of violations (e.g. missing borrower financial statements or broken ratios). Any material exceptions or violations should be explicitly noted in the review findings and reported upwards[21]. The bank should then take action: require justification and higher-level approval for policy exceptions, or issue waivers/amendments for covenants if appropriate, coupled with risk mitigation (like obtaining additional collateral or guarantees). It’s also good practice to maintain an exceptions log – a report that goes to the board showing all policy exceptions granted, so the board understands if exceptions are becoming too frequent. For covenants, ensure that a covenant compliance report is regularly reviewed by credit administration and that loan officers address breaches promptly (for example, by meeting with the borrower or strengthening terms). By actively monitoring these items, you’ll reinforce adherence to the bank’s risk appetite and catch potential problems at the incipient stage, rather than after a loan deteriorates.
7. Failure to Follow Up on Identified Issues
The Mistake: Conducting a thorough loan review and then not following up on the findings is a mistake that can negate all the upfront effort. This occurs when issues uncovered during loan review – such as missing documents, needed collateral fixes, or recommended risk rating changes – are noted in the report but then no one ensures they get resolved. It’s the “paper tiger” review that identifies problems but doesn’t lead to corrective action. For instance, loan review might flag that a borrower’s financial statements are outdated or that a lien is imperfect, yet months later those issues remain unaddressed.
Why It Matters: Both internal best practices and regulatory guidance emphasize that findings of loan reviews must be acted upon. Loan review isn’t just an academic exercise; its value comes when management remedies deficiencies and mitigates risks identified. The FDIC exam manual explicitly states that “any existing or planned corrective action (including timeframes) is obtained for all noted deficiencies,” and unresolved issues should be reported to senior management and the board[22]. If there’s no follow-up, the same issues will persist or worsen, and examiners will see that management is not taking loan review seriously. In essence, failing to follow up undermines the entire purpose of the review system, which is to actually improve portfolio quality and risk controls.
Consequences: The obvious consequence is unresolved credit weaknesses that can escalate into losses. For example, if loan review found that a borrower’s collateral was not properly insured but nobody followed up, the bank could incur a loss if that collateral is damaged. Or if a loan was identified as needing downgrade but wasn’t downgraded in the system, the Allowance for Losses might be understated, leading to a sudden catch-up expense later. From an oversight perspective, examiners will likely cite this as a repeat finding in subsequent examinations – noting that issues identified in prior reviews or exams were not corrected. This can lead to harsher supervisory actions, since it reflects poorly on the bank’s management and board oversight. It can even affect management’s ratings in the exam (part of CAMELS) if the pattern suggests management is ineffective or inattentive.
How to Avoid/Fix: Establish a strong follow-up process and accountability for loan review findings. One approach is to maintain a tracking log of all issues identified in each loan review (e.g. “Financial statement for 2022 missing for Borrower A” or “Obtain updated appraisal on Property B”). Assign each item to a specific owner (a loan officer or credit admin staff) and set a due date. Loan review or credit risk management staff should regularly check on these and escalate if deadlines slip. It’s also effective to have summary reports: for example, report to the senior management or credit committee on the status of all open loan review issues (how many resolved vs. pending). Per guidance, any significant issues that remain unresolved should be reported to the board or a board committee[22] – this puts pressure to get them fixed. Culturally, reinforce that loan review is not “gotcha” but a helpful risk tool: loan officers should understand that addressing these findings will protect them and the bank from future problems. Additionally, consider linking part of management’s performance evaluation to how promptly they clear issues identified by reviewers. By creating a disciplined feedback loop – identify, assign, resolve, report – you ensure the loan review process leads to concrete improvements in loan administration and risk management.
8. Underqualified or Insufficient Loan Review Staff
The Mistake: Some banks undermine their own loan review effectiveness by staffing the function with inexperienced or under-trained personnel, or simply not enough personnel. This mistake can be subtle – perhaps the lone loan review officer is very junior, or reviewers don’t receive ongoing training in new regulations or industry trends. In other cases, a bank grows its loan portfolio but doesn’t proportionally increase loan review resources. Without skilled and adequately resourced staff, even a well-designed loan review program will falter in execution.
Why It Matters: The quality of loan review is only as good as the people performing it. Regulatory guidance underscores that loan review personnel should be qualified by education, experience, and formal credit training[23]. They need a strong understanding of sound lending practices and the bank’s own policies. If the staff lack experience (for instance, they don’t recognize early signs of borrower trouble or aren’t familiar with complex credit structures), they may overlook issues or misidentify risks. Additionally, if too few people are reviewing too many loans, they might cut corners or only perform shallow reviews due to time constraints. Regulators and auditors can usually tell when a loan review lacks depth or misses obvious red flags – it points back to staffing problems. Moreover, keeping loan review staff skills current is important, as accounting rules (like CECL), market conditions, and regulatory expectations evolve over time.
Consequences: An underqualified staff leads to errors and omissions in the loan review. This could mean bad loans remain pass-grade until it’s too late, or concentration risks aren’t recognized – essentially many of the mistakes on this list can result from not having the right expertise in the review team. It can also result in high turnover or burnout if a small team is overworked, which then creates continuity gaps. From a supervisory angle, examiners might explicitly note that loan review staff lack sufficient expertise or that the function is understaffed for the size of the portfolio, possibly in the Report of Examination. This could come with recommendations (or requirements) to hire additional qualified staff or engage third-party consultants. In the worst case, a persistent lack of capability in loan review could contribute to significant undetected credit deterioration and threaten the bank’s safety and soundness.
How to Avoid/Fix: Invest in your loan review team’s quality and capacity. First, ensure the hiring criteria for loan reviewers include strong credit analysis backgrounds – for example, previous experience in commercial lending, credit analysis, or bank examinations. If your institution is smaller and can’t have a large team, consider outsourcing some reviews to experienced external firms or sharing resources across departments (while maintaining independence). Second, provide ongoing training for the reviewers. Topics might include new regulatory guidance (like updated OCC/FDIC rules), emerging risks (e.g. how to review loans in newer industries or fintech lending), or simply refreshers on financial analysis and cash flow modeling. As one industry expert noted, “An effectively trained loan review staff can detect issues before they become costly,” saving the bank money in the long run[24]. Cross-training within the bank is also valuable – for instance, have reviewers attend loan committee meetings to understand the front-end process better (as observers, not as decision-makers). Third, right-size the team: match the volume and complexity of loans to the number of reviewers and frequency of reviews. If the loan portfolio has grown significantly or shifted into more complex areas (like syndicated loans or specialized lending), adjust your staffing accordingly. Finally, management should foster an environment where the loan review function is respected and its career path is valued – this helps attract and retain talent. When bank executives support professional development and sufficient staffing for loan review, they directly improve the institution’s risk management outcomes.
9. Weak Loan Review Governance and Oversight
The Mistake: Sometimes the oversight of the loan review function itself is lacking. This mistake includes not having a strong loan review policy, not updating it regularly, or not involving the board and senior management appropriately. For example, a bank might have a very generic loan review policy that doesn’t spell out scope, frequency, or responsibilities, or perhaps the board never sees loan review reports (or sees them only infrequently). In essence, the loan review program may exist on paper but is not embedded into the bank’s governance framework.
Why It Matters: Both OCC and FDIC expect banks to have a formal, board-approved loan review policy and active oversight of the loan review process. Per regulatory guidance, an effective credit risk review system “starts with a written credit risk review policy… reviewed and typically approved at least annually by the institution’s board of directors.”[25][26] This policy should cover key elements (qualifications of personnel, independence, scope, frequency, reporting, etc.) to give the program structure[26]. Moreover, safety and soundness standards require regular communication of loan portfolio performance to management and the board[3]. If governance is weak – say the board isn’t getting reports, or senior management isn’t involved in setting review priorities – the loan review function can become ineffective or misaligned. Strong oversight ensures accountability and that the loan review’s insights are actually used in decision-making.
Consequences: Without robust governance, loan review may devolve into a check-the-box exercise with little impact. The board could be caught off-guard by deteriorating asset quality because they weren’t kept informed (a very dangerous scenario for directors, who are ultimately responsible for the bank’s condition). Examiners will also flag this: a common comment is along the lines of “the loan review function lacks board oversight or a comprehensive policy.” That could become part of a Matters Requiring Attention (MRA) or similar supervisory finding. Additionally, lacking a clear policy can lead to inconsistencies – different reviewers might apply different standards, or reviews might be skipped during busy periods because there’s no mandated schedule. The absence of clear governance can thus indirectly cause many of the other mistakes on this list. Ultimately, poor governance erodes the effectiveness of risk management and can contribute to larger issues if credit problems accumulate unnoticed.
How to Avoid/Fix: Treat the loan review function as a key component of the bank’s risk governance. Start by drafting or updating the Loan Review Policy to include: objectives of loan review, independence and reporting structure, qualification requirements for reviewers, how often reviews occur and how scope is determined, how findings are reported and followed up, etc. Have this policy reviewed and approved by the board annually[26] – this forces a yearly check-in on whether the program is up to date with the bank’s current strategy and regulatory expectations. Ensure the board of directors and senior management receive regular reports summarizing loan review results[19]. It’s a good practice for the Chief Credit Officer or Loan Review Manager to present findings in board risk committee meetings, highlighting key issues and trends. The board (or a designated committee) should also receive metrics on the loan review’s effectiveness, such as number of loans reviewed, % of portfolio covered, and significant changes or downgrades. Another governance aspect is alignment with audit and risk management: while loan review should be independent of audit, coordination can be useful (for example, audit can periodically audit the loan review function itself to ensure it’s following policy). Lastly, regulators have provided ample guidance (OCC, FDIC, Fed via the interagency guidance) – use those as a benchmark to self-assess your loan review program’s design. By tightening governance and oversight, bank executives send a message that loan portfolio review is a priority, which will bolster its credibility and effectiveness.
10. Reactive Rather Than Proactive Reviews
The Mistake: The final common mistake is adopting a reactive approach – only scrutinizing the loan portfolio after problems have become obvious (e.g. after loans are past due or an examiner flags issues), rather than running a proactive, ongoing review process. Signs of this mistake include doing loan reviews “just before the exam” in a rush, focusing only on loans that are already non-performing, or not updating risk assessments until a borrower actually defaults. Essentially, it’s when loan review is not truly continuous or risk-based, but rather lags behind events.
Why It Matters: A core objective of loan review is early identification of credit weaknesses so that action can be taken to minimize losses[9]. If reviews are reactive, the bank loses the opportunity to turn the ship before it hits the iceberg. Regulators expect that “significant credits are reviewed at least annually or more frequently when factors indicate potential for deteriorating credit quality.”[13] Waiting until a loan is 90+ days delinquent or until renewal time, for instance, might be too late. A proactive loan review (and credit monitoring) culture is especially important during times of economic change – you want to catch loans that are starting to show stress before they require restructuring or charge-off. Banks that only chase problems after they fully surface often suffer larger losses and more severe regulatory outcomes than those that act in advance.
Consequences: A reactive approach means missed opportunities to mitigate risk. By the time a problem is evident (say the borrower stops paying), options are fewer – collateral might be impaired, or the borrower’s business might have already deteriorated beyond repair. The bank could have, for example, negotiated better terms or obtained guarantor support if it had spotted the trouble earlier. Furthermore, examiners can tell if a bank is only reacting. If, during an exam, all the downgrades happen at once or just in anticipation of the exam, it indicates the internal process isn’t functioning continuously. This can result in criticisms for weak risk monitoring. The bank might also experience earnings strain because a wave of loan downgrades and provisions hit all at once, rather than being spread out by gradual, earlier recognition. In a broader sense, a reactive stance on credit risk can threaten the bank’s stability if an economic downturn hits – those who are proactive may adjust underwriting and strengthen reserves ahead of the storm, while reactive banks get caught off guard.
How to Avoid/Fix: Embed proactivity into loan portfolio management. This starts with loan review scheduling: don’t just review loans on an annual calendar – supplement that with trigger-based reviews. For example, if a borrower’s financial statement arrives and shows a sharp drop in revenue, don’t wait for the annual review date; have a mechanism to review and potentially downgrade that credit immediately. Similarly, use early warning indicators (like sector credit spreads, market news about major employers in the area, etc.) to inform your review focus. Maintain a watch list of loans that, while still performing, show signs of potential weakness, and review those more frequently (quarterly or monthly updates)[7][27]. Another tactic is portfolio stress testing or sensitivity analysis as part of reviews – ask “what if” questions (e.g. what if interest rates rise 2% for our borrowers, who might struggle?). If the test identifies a group of loans that would come under stress, proactively reach out to those borrowers or review their credit now. Culturally, encourage lenders to view loan review as a partnership in risk management: they should flag concerns to the review team early on, rather than hiding them. Finally, ensure that credit risk review is ongoing – between formal review cycles, the credit administration or risk management team should continuously monitor the portfolio’s health (delinquencies, covenant compliance, external economic indicators) and not hesitate to take action or schedule an interim review when needed. By being proactive, the bank can often rehabilitate a credit or exit a bad situation on better terms, and it will certainly impress regulators by exemplifying strong risk management. Remember, as the saying goes, “fix the roof while the sun is shining” – don’t wait for the downpour to discover the leaks in your loan portfolio.
