# Understanding DSCR

The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is one of the most relied-upon metrics in commercial credit. It compares net operating income to total debt service, giving lenders a quick view of repayment ability.

However, DSCR should never be analyzed in isolation. Seasonal cash flows, balloon maturities, and changes in interest rates can all make a “comfortable” DSCR misleading. A lender should also consider:
- Historical trends
- Stress-tested scenarios
- Alignment with UCA cash flow analysis

A well-rounded DSCR review incorporates both historical performance and forward-looking projections.
