# Loan Covenants Banks Should Never Skip

Loan covenants serve as early warning indicators and protective measures for lenders. While excessive covenants can frustrate borrowers, the right mix helps detect risk early without damaging the relationship.

Examples of high-value covenants include:
- Minimum DSCR requirements
- Leverage ratio caps
- Restrictions on additional indebtedness
- Reporting requirements for interim financials

These measures allow banks to take proactive steps if performance begins to slip.
