# UCA Cash Flow Analysis Made Simple

Uniform Credit Analysis (UCA) cash flow turns accrual-based financial statements into a view of how cash truly moves through a business. Unlike EBITDA, UCA considers changes in working capital and other real-world factors that impact liquidity.

The process starts with net income, adjusts for non-cash items, and then incorporates changes in receivables, inventory, and payables. The result is a clear picture of the borrowerâ€™s true cash flow available for debt service.

This method is especially valuable in industries with volatile inventory cycles or delayed receivable collections.
