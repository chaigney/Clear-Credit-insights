summary: "Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions—how to apply them with modern DSCR and UCA cash flow discipline."
---

The 5 Cs of Credit—**Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions**—are the cornerstone of commercial lending. Consistency matters: apply the framework the same way across deals and document the rationale clearly in your memo.

### Character
Assess ownership and management credibility: repayment history, legal filings, references, governance, and transparency. Red flags include frequent ownership changes, unresolved liens, or poor communication.

### Capacity
Evaluate ability to repay via **UCA cash flow**, DSCR, and sensitivity to margin or revenue compression. Model base, downside, and severe cases; test covenants (e.g., minimum DSCR, leverage caps) against each case.

### Capital
Measure the borrower’s “skin in the game.” Review tangible net worth, leverage, and subordination agreements. Strong capitalization absorbs volatility and aligns incentives.

### Collateral
Define secondary repayment sources and liquidation value. Align LTV/advance rates with asset quality and market depth. Document appraisals, inspection frequency, and collateral controls (e.g., ABL borrowing bases).

### Conditions
Factor in sector trends, cyclicality, competitive dynamics, and regulatory or macroeconomic risks. Ensure loan purpose/structure (tenor, amortization, pricing) matches cash cycle and asset life.

*Takeaway:* A disciplined 5Cs framework, combined with timely financials, industry benchmarking, and transparent borrower dialogue, produces faster approvals and fewer surprises.
